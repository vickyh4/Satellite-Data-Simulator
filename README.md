**Object Oriented Programming (Satellite and Device Simulator)**

In this project I created a series of devices (Laptop, Mobile and Desktop) and satelittes (Standard, Shrinking, Relay) to simulate file data transfer between any two of these objects with consideration to environmental and individual object constraints.

**Language: Java**

**Description:**
So much of today's technology uses Global Positioning System (GPS) information.  For example, tagging photographs with their location, guiding drivers with car navigation systems, and even missile control systems. There are currently 31 active GPS satellites (as of the time of writing this) orbiting the Earth all together providing near-constant GPS coverage.

In the far future, society has become advanced to the point where they have begun to occupy a series of moons and asteroids around the planet Jupiter. Individuals rely on satellites for all their communication desires. Three major satellites exist around Jupiter.
This assessment aims to provide you with design experience for a non-trivial system. 

You will be architecting and modelling how these multiple satellites will communicate and function with various devices.  The form of communication that you will be simulating is a simplified version of the modern internet, simply just file transfer.  You can either upload a file to a satellite from a device, download a file from a satellite to a device, or send a file from a satellite to a satellite.

Your solution should adopt an Object-Oriented approach that utilises concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, composition, and inheritance, as taught in lectures.
